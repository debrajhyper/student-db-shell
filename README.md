## Conclusion
This shell script provides a basic implementation of a CRUD operation on a list of student records using arrays, switch statements, and loops. It provides a simple menu-driven interface that allows the user to perform different operations on the list. However, this implementation is not suitable for managing large amounts of data, and does not provide any data validation.
